# A Beginner's Self-Study Guide to Learning Cybersecurity
> Author: Z

## Purpose
This guide is designed to help beginners get started in the field of cybersecurity by providing a comprehensive list of resources. It also includes advanced sections for those looking to deepen their knowledge.
I've been on my journey in Cybersecurity for a little while now and I just wanted a space to share resources that I found the most helpful. If you find this helpful, please pay it forward, star it, and share it with others.

I will continue to update as I learn and look forward to any new resources you may share.

## What is Cybersecurity? <a name="what-is-cybersecurity"></a>
Cybersecurity is all about keeping our digital world safe and sound. When you go home it's not a good idea (best practice) to leave your doors unlocked or the window open all the time. Think of one level of cybersecurity as locking the doors and windows and hiring a security guard for your online life, protecting your data, devices, and networks from shady people. Whether itâ€™s securing your socials and finances, or defending against cyberattacks, cybersecurity is absolutely necessary these days. Everyone can play a part in making the internet safer. Even Grandma and Grandpa can help by not opening an email from a Nigerian Prince. Let's get to it.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
This section is all about where to get the information. We have all heard the phrase knowledge is power. The phrase should have been "[Applied] knowledge is power." Below you'll find content to help you get the fundamentals under your belt, and later on, you'll learn how and where to apply it.

## Learning the Basics <a name="learning-the-basics"></a>
### Online Courses <a name="online-courses"></a>
- **Coursera:** Was a great starting place for me and I always recommend it. Especially if you are a self-learner the structure provided by the Google Certificate in Cyber course is a great place to get your feet wet. Here are a few cyber-related courses I recommend from the platform.
  - [Google Certificate in Cyber (Fundamentals)](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity)
- **Udemy:** Udemy courses can be great too, but try to avoid the junk out there. Here are some courses I recommend if you are interested in the Cloud.
