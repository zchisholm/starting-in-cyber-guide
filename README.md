# A Beginner's Self-Study Guide to Learning Cybersecurity
> Author: Z

## Purpose
This guide is designed to help beginners get started in the field of cybersecurity by providing a comprehensive list of resources. It also includes advanced sections for those looking to deepen their knowledge.
I've been on my journey in Cybersecurity for a little while now and I just wanted a space to share resources that I found the most helpful. My hope for you is that you find something here helpful for your journey. If you find this helpful, please pay it forward, star it, and share it with others.

I will continue to update as I learn and look forward to any new resources you may share.

## What is Cybersecurity? <a name="what-is-cybersecurity"></a>
Cybersecurity is all about keeping our digital world safe and sound. When you go home it's not a good idea (best practice) to leave your doors unlocked or the window open all the time. Think of one level of cybersecurity as locking the doors and windows and hiring a security guard for your online life, protecting your data, devices, and networks from shady people. Whether itâ€™s securing your socials and finances, or defending against cyberattacks, cybersecurity is absolutely necessary these days. Everyone can play a part in making the internet safer. Even Grandma and Grandpa can help by not opening an email from a Nigerian Prince. Let's get to it.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
This section is all about where to get the information. We have all heard the phrase knowledge is power. The phrase should have been "[Applied] knowledge is power." Below you'll find content to help you get the fundamentals under your belt, and later on, you'll learn how and where to apply it.

## Learning the Basics <a name="learning-the-basics"></a>
First and foremost, you need to have a basic understanding of how the internet works. You can protect what you don't understand. Here is a great video to get you started. I encourage you to look up others and try to get a solid feel for howt the internet works. If there is a word or term in the video that doesn't make sense... Google it. You have all the knowledge of the world at your fingertips.
