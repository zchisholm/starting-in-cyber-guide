## What is Cybersecurity? <a name="what-is-cybersecurity"></a>
Cybersecurity is all about keeping our digital world safe and sound. When you go home it's not best practice to leave you doors unlocked or the window open all the timne. Think of cybersecurity like locking the doors and windows and hiring a security guard for your online life, protecting your data, devices, and networks from shady people. Whether itâ€™s securing your socials, finances, or defending against cyberattacks, cybersecurity is absolutely necessary these days. Everyone can play a part in making the internet safer. Even Grandma and Grandpa. Let's get to it.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>
